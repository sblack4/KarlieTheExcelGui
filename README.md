This is what it is:

A simple tkinter gui that takes input and gives output.
A program based on pandas to open excel files, manipulate them as data frames, and write them out in a new format.

Written in python 3 using pandas and tkinter 
Please feel free to whatever :) I also packaged it into a .exe with pyinstaller which was awesome!
